#### contraints
1.  The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
2.  The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!
3.  Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
4.  Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!
5.  Format your results properly!!
